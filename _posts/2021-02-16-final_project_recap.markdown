This is a final project for the FlatIron's Software Engineering Bootcamp. I envisioned it as a simplified web store with a rudimentary ordering page and back page for administration.   
  
Due to time constrains I've decided not to include user authentication or categories. 

Project went largely ok with couple of surprises. When I needed to implement iterating update to the database I faced some unusual errors that were due to SQLite3 database I was developing on. Instructor suggested to switch the database to PostGres but again, due to time constrains I didn't get around to do that. 

In general I kept running into difficulties with constant manipulations of nested arrays and nested objects in my Redux state. That was probably the most difficult issue I faced when coding. In retrospect I should have organized a project better with simpler, easier to access state. 

In my defense it is my first React project and I have already started my second one which already goes a little easier. Practice makes perfect as they say. r blog post goes here.
