After Sinatra we've gotten really in depth with web frameworks with Rails. In the beginning I was impressed how easily it handled issues that were complex in Sinatra. Generators were amazing! CRUD, which took, days to complete in Sinatra was being completed in an hour. Minutes if you used scaffold generator. 

Form helpers and Rails magic it provided were cool. Same form that differentiated between 'new' and 'edit' actions. Submit button that dynamically changed. Magic! Actually it IS called Rails magic. 

But soon I run into issues with it. It became cumbersome, not a joy to use, with many strict rules that you had to follow or "magic" didn't happen. Issues came from unexpected places. Things that I thought would be easy ended up giving me most problems in the course. Issues like nested forms, partials (biggest surprise - had a very hard time with that lab), and even helpers. 

At this point, at the end of the segment and after doing the project I can't say I like Rails. It is powerful and it is the only full featured framework I know, but I definitely want to try the other ones. Maybe I just need more time with it, I still don't know the syntax and I find myself constantly looking up how the things are done, which is normal I guess at this point. We'll see how it goes as the material progresses since we'll be sticking with Rails until the rest of this course. I just hope I get some of my enthusiasm back because, during this project, I found myself at points where I was dreading sitting behind the keyboard and coding. Nothing was too hard, I was just not looking forward to it. And for the first time in the last six months or so. 

My project assignment went rather well. I chose a real world example based on the needs of the company I currently work for. Because it was a real world example it was hard to fit it correctly within the project parameters but I think I did it rather successfully. There are certain "weird" little things like "join" table being the focal point of the project and everything starts from it. My has many through relationship is utilized only to show that it's working, it's is not crucial for the project (I'm making a correction here, I found a use for it.) 

Most challenging and I must say most enjoyable part of this project was working on JavaScript portion of it. It is telling when your most enjoyable part is something that is not even the on the spec of the project. 

I also implemented CSS framework which was rather fun if not on the specs. It was useful to learn and in the end helpful since I just wanted pre-made looks and didn't want to spend too much time on defining CSS styles. It made my project look ten times better in the matter of minutes and it was great. Working with flex-boxes was also crucial for the design. 

Biggest regret during this project was that I've run out of time to implement Action Cable portion of it - live chat. I think that would have been great to work on and fun in the end. I have the idea worked out so if the time permits I will go back and implement it. At least for the proof of concept. 

In the end, it was good to get this project under my belt and it is good to have coded through adversity and apathy. I'm sure that will happen again in my career (and again... and again) Results are good, it looks very presentable and it could be useful thing for the company. It is something I wouldn't be ashamed showing to the higher ups at work.
