Java Script segment of the Flat Iron course is well envisioned. Plan was to start using it right away, skipping the programming and language basics because it was assumed students got those in previous segments (i.e. Procedural and Object Oriented Ruby.) I liked the idea in the beginning but realized very soon that it was horrible, horrible idea to skip the fundamentals and jump in the middle of it. 

Best example of this are methods(in Ruby) / functions in (JS). In Ruby they're simple, straightforward constructs where not much can go wrong. In JS functions are much more loose but also much more important. Functions section shows up in the middle of the course, once we're all utterly confused with them. To this day I'm (and all other students I'm talking to) utterly confused by them, by the scope specially. "This" is still a surprise for me every time. Every time I have to "console.log" to see "where I am", I still don't know a proper way to invoke a function, when to use certain ways I've picked up. 

Everything in this course came upside down and out of place and nothing is yet fitting in place. Every step of the way was very frustrating. Final project was no exception. First time in this course I found myself stuck and unable to proceed. I had to pay for another JS course just to figure out what to do in this project. Still, without the help of our cohort leader I wouldn't be able to complete it. Just the fact that I had to pay for another course in order to figure out what is going on in this course is a bad sign for the quality of the material. My suspicion that something is wrong with this course was confirmed privately by numerous instructors I was asking for help with labs during the course. Nobody had anything positive to say about it and everyone's suggestion was just suffer through it and push forward and be done with it. If anyone is reading this (Avi) PLEASE REWORK THIS SEGMENT OF THE COURSE. IT'S HORRIBLE!!!

And if future students are reading this, do yourself a favor and pay the money for JS30 JS beginner's course. It will help you a lot, infinitely better than this material! I wish I found it earlier and had time to go over it before I started this segment. When I found it I didn't have time to leave this course and complete that one first but I was doing it in parallel, looking for the solutions for the concrete problems that I had during the project. 

Rant over!
