I’ve been on the fringes of an IT world and programming but never really in it. Working as a desktop support I’ve often had to help development team in testing or troubleshooting even the small coding assignments but could never got fully into it.
As I feel more and more stuck in my career with nowhere interesting and productive to go, I found this course as a perfect opportunity to improve both myself and my career opportunities. I have started numerous times to learn coding on my own but always got stuck or interrupted at some point or another. I obviously need more structured learning environment. This boot camp seemed like a perfect opportunity.
